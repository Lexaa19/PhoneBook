# PhoneBook

The problem is that I don't know how to arrange the information. So, I have a first name, a last name and a phone number.

The map can only hold 2 of them, so how can I solve the problem?

I made a map with first name and last name, and a map with the last name (as it is unique) and the phone number to connect them somehow.
Initially the code was much more complicated, I created a nested map and I realized that it was not ok, or maybe it was?
